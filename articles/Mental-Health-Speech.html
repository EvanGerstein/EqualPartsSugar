    <h2>Information</h2>
    <p>
        During 1st period PE students had to sit on the bleachers and watch a PowerPoint Speech Similar to the say no to drugs speech the speech was about resilience and involved content like cancel culture and Social media. There were two presenters, one on the left Tia (female Charlie Kirk) who was the one in charge and an intern Lauren who was the main speaker. They were both Liberal Millennials and trying to make corny jokes.
<br><br>
They made students write stuff on their iPad like who inspires you, what’s a nice thing about yourself. In return they would receive a stress ball.
<br><br>
When Andrew was asked about someone who overcame a challenge he mentioned Mr Pino missing a shot during the Teacher Vs Students basketball game and feeling inspired but wasn’t able to finish his answer since students on the bleachers kept laughing. Mr. Pino went back to the mainstream when they asked who do you trust to talk to and than a student answered Mr. Pino.
<br><br>
They talked about stuff like how it is apparently normal to talk to yourself and somehow your future self to feel better about yourself.
